### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page. Great to meet you!

My name is JosÃ©. I'm a clinical neuroscientist and scientific software developer at the [Analysis and Modelling of Complex Data](https://methoden.amd.psychologie.uni-mainz.de/jose-c-garcia-alanis/) at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, and at the Department of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology at Philipps-UniversitÃ¤t Marburg, Germany.

My background is in experimental psychology and statistical modelling. I'm currently wrapping up my Ph.D. at Philipps-UniversitÃ¤t Marburg, where I focus on linking brain function and structure to cognitive processes that foster behavioral adaptation.

As a software developer, I specialize in designing and improving data preprocessing and analysis pipelines for various types of data. I'm particularly interested in enhancing the reproducibility and sustainability of research projects in clinical neurosciences. Most of my software development is in Python; see [here](https://josealanis.github.io/mne-stats/index.html) and [here](https://github.com/JoseAlanis/eeg_patterns_dpx) for examples.

I enjoy collaborating with colleagues by conducting workshops in both Python and R. For instance, you can see [here](https://github.com/JoseAlanis/WoMepS-2023-reproduceR). I also currently maintain the documentation for various projects, such as [here](josealanis.github.io/amdstatsem/), [here](https://amd-lab.github.io/R-Kurs-Buch/) and [here](https://amd-lab.github.io/sona-researcher-jgu/).
