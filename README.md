### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my Github website. Great to meet you!

I'm a researcher and scientific software developer at the [Analysis and Modelling of Complex Data](https://methoden.amd.psychologie.uni-mainz.de/jose-c-garcia-alanis/) at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. My work focuses on developing and improving data preprocessing and analysis pipelines for time-series data. I do software development in Python and R (see [here](https://gist.github.com/JoseAlanis/08d75e49ab30630adb34774107cc8a75) and [here](https://amd-lab.github.io/R-Kurs-Buch/) for some examples).

I also like to collaborate with giving workshops, for both Python and R (see [here](https://peerherholz.github.io/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/introduction_general.html) and [here](https://amd-lab.github.io/R-Kurs-Buch/) for some examples).

My background is in experimental psychology. I'm currently wrapping up my PhD at Philipps-UniversitÃ¤t Marburg.

I advocate for open, reproducible, and robust scientific practices and am an active open-source community member.
